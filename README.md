# prophet-challenge

## Overview
This project analyzes Google search traffic patterns and their relationship with MercadoLibre's financial results and stock price movements. By leveraging data from May 2020, the analysis aims to uncover insights that can drive strategic decision-making and marketing efforts for the company.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into four key parts:

1. **Unusual Patterns in Search Traffic**  

2. **Seasonality Analysis of Search Traffic**  
   
3. **Correlation of Search Traffic and Stock Prices**  
   
4. **Time Series Forecasting with Prophet**  
   

## Key Findings
- **Traffic Increase**: There was a significant rise in search traffic in May 2020 coinciding with the financial results release, indicating a strong influence of such events on user behavior.
- **Seasonality**: Search traffic patterns exhibit clear time-based trends, with notable variations throughout the day and week, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing.
- **Stock Price Correlation**: While some correlations between search traffic and stock volatility were observed, they are not strong enough for reliable predictions.
- **Prophet Model Insights**: The model identified that midday hours typically have the highest search traffic, while January sees the lowest, providing valuable information for marketing strategies.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Open the `forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment that supports Prophet, such as Google Colab.
2. Execute each cell using the play button or by pressing `Shift + Enter` to run the code and view outputs.

## Conclusion
Understanding the dynamics of search traffic in relation to financial events can provide valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and improving return on investment (ROI). This analysis not only enhances our understanding of user behavior but also aids in making data-driven decisions for MercadoLibreâ€™s growth.
